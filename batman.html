<p><b> Summary </b></p></font>
<h3>On Earth -22, the Joker's insane rampage across Gotham City caused Batman to finally snap, breaking his long-held creed to never take a life, snapping the Clown Prince of Crime's neck to end the threat he posed once and for all. Unbeknownst to him, this released a special strain of Joker Venom that Batman inhaled, slowly twisting his moral fiber until he was no different from the Joker himself.

After slaughtering his own family and dismantling the entirety of the Justice League, he proceeded to wage war on all of creation, methodically killing every last man, woman, and child on Earth. Now known as The Batman Who Laughs, he serves as the favored lieutenant of Barbatos, seeking to plunge the entire multiverse into eternal darkness as he had done with his own world.</h3>
